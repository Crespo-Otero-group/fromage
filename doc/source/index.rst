fromage
==================================

**fromage** is a library designed to support the manipulation and optimisation of
molecular crystal structures. It provides an interface between popular
electronic structure programs for cross-program ONIOM-style calculations. A
suite of analysis tools is also included to calculate excitonic couplings,
population analysis statistics and volumetric information. The program follows a
modular object-oriented paradigm, making it ideal for integration with other
scripts.
