cryspy
==================================

cryspy is a library designed to support the manipulation and optimisation of
molecular crystal structures. It provides an interface between popular electronic
structure programs for cross-program ONIOM-style calculations. A suite of analysis
tools is also included to calculate excitonic couplings, population analysis
statistics and volumetric information. The program follows a modular object-oriented
paradigm, making it ideal for integration with other scripts.
