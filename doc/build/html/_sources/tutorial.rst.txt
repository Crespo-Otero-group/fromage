Tutorial
########

This tutorial will guide you step by step through the geometry optimisation of
the (2-hydroxyphenyl)propenone crystal using the Self-Consistent Ewald Cluster
(SCEEC) model. Wherever relevant, we will indicate which steps to replace if you
wish to use the Ewald Embedded Model (EEC) non-self-consistently or a
traditional electrostatic embedding model which we call the Embedded Cluster
(EC) model.

We have provided the necessary input files in the :code:`tutorial` directory. We
follow the ONIOM nomenclature for the different regions of the embedded cluster.
In other words the whole cluster is the "real" system while the central
molecule(s) is(are) called the "model" system. We abbreviate the principal
components involved in the ONIOM method as :code:`mh` for the model system at a
high level of theory, :code:`ml` for the model system at a low level of theory
and :code:`rl` for the real system at a low level of theory. For the location of
conical intersections, a fourth calculation is typically involved, :code:`mg`,
which indicates the real system at the high level of theory but in the ground
state.

==================

Necessary input files
---------------------

* :code:`cell.xyz`: A file containting the optimised positions of the atoms in
  the unit cell

* :code:`config`: The cryspy configuration file, described below

* :code:`high_pop.log`: A Gaussian output file of a population analysis for one
  molecule using the high level of theory (in this case PBE 6-31G*)

* :code:`low_pop.log`: The same but for the low level of theory (here, HF
  STO-3G)

* :code:`*.template`: The template files for your upcoming ONIOM calculation
