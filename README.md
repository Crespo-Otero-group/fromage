# cryspy

This program offers interface for 2-level ONIOM calculations in between quantum packages.
There is a heavy emphasis on applications for molecular crystals and as such different Ewald embedding schemes are implemented.

## 1 Installation

1. Make sure that you have all the required dependencies:
  - Python 2.7 and above (Python 3 recommended)
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - Hacked version of Ewald (the source code for this will be uploaded soon)
2. Clone this repository to wherever you want to install it:
  ```bash
    cd /path/to/dir
    git clone https://github.research.its.qmul.ac.uk/btx156/cryspy.git
  ```
 3. Add the installation directory to your system path by adding the following to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:
  ```bash
    export PATH=/path/to/dir/cryspy:$PATH
    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/dir/cryspy$PYTHONPATH
  ```
  VoilÃ !


The main two modules in cryspy are `prepare_calculation.py` and `cryspy.py`. The former produces template files and geometry files to be used in the latter for geometry optimisation or minimal energy conical intersection (MECI) search.
Following the standard ONIOM nomenclature, the central system which is only treated at the high level of theory is called the 'model' system.
The whole system is called the 'real' system.
As such the three parallel calculations which are carried out are called `mh` for `model high`, `ml` for `model low`, `rl` for `real low`.
For MECI search, an additional calculation of the high level region for the ground state gradients is necessary and is labeled `mg`.

## 2 Preparing the calculation
`prepare_calculation.py` requires:
  - A `.xyz` file of a unit cell
  - A `config`
  - A file containing the high level embedding charges
  - A file containting the low level embedding charges
  - A set of `*.template` files for `mh`, `ml` and `rl` (`mg` too for MECI search)
  
And optionally:

  - A `.xyz` target shell file
  - A self consistent calculation template file
   
### 2.1 Unit cell file

This is the kind of file which is typically produced from a periodic DFT calculation.
Avoid double counted atoms outside the unit cell which might be snuk in by visualization programs such as VESTA.
If you deem that geometry optimisation of your cell is unnecessary (publish this result because I am interested) you will need to convert a `.cif` file into a unit cell `.xyz` file.
For this I recommend [Open Babel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page) which would use the syntax:
  ```bash
    babel -i -cif cell.cif -o -xyz cell.xyz -filluc
  ```
The `-filluc` keyword is crucial otherwise you will end up with an asymmetric unit of the cell.

### 2.2 Configuration file

The `config` file is a list of keywords followed by their values which the user should input.
A set of reasonable default values is coded in `parse_config_file` for every keyword except for the lattice vectors which can not be assumed.

If you use the `target_shell` keyword you will need to supply the program with an additional target shell `.xyz` file to specify the shell that you want in your real system.

### 2.3 Population analysis files

These files contain the starting (and in some cases also ending) values for the charges that you intend to use in your embedding.
The high level charges will eventually be used in the embedding of the `mh` calculation and can be fitted to the Ewald potentially directly or self consitently.
They need to be extracted from a Gaussian output file or in the special case of direct Ewald embedding a CP2K >= 4.1 file will do as well.
For the low level embedding, only Gaussian is available.

It is crucial that you match the population analysis from the low level charges to the low level of theory in order to properly cancel out the electrostatic intreactions from `rl`.
The choice of high level charges is more subtle but consistency would have you use the same level of theory as in `mh`.

### 2.4 Primitive template files

These files are named `mh.template`, `ml.template`, `rl.template` and optionally `mg.template`.
They serve as model template files with a blank name for the checkpoint file, blank calculation name, blank atomic positions and blank point charges.
Prepare calculations populates all of these fields except for the atomic positions which will later be repeatedly updated by the optimisation procedure.
It is important to include the following keywords:

`charge` : allows for the use of point charge embedding (not actually used in `rl`
`symmetry=none` : conserves the input geometry throughout the calculation, making the position of the charges correct
`force` : to calculate the energy gradients necessary for the optimisation

### 2.5 Target shell file

In certain cases, the cluster of molecules generated radially will be unpractical due to the packing of the crystal.
For example it may need to include a large number of distant molecules to also include a certain nearest neighbour molecule.
In those cases a shell file can be manually edited in the user's favourite chemistry visualisation software to remove extra molecules.
In that case a target shell file can be supplied which will be used to genereate `rl` and `ml`.
Be extra careful that the central molecule has the correct orientation with respect to your generated cluster.
It is recommended to use the shell file from a large radius calculation and manually strip it down to only the nearest neighbour molecules.

### 2.6 Self consistent template file

This is the Gaussian template file used if the Ewald charge background is computed self consistently.
It has the same form as the primitive template files.
The level of theory here can be chosen to be in excited state for a fully excited crystal.
If this is your intention, don't forget to use `density=current` to make sure that your population analysis is in the excited state and not the ground state.

### 2.7 Outputs of the preparation

Once you have finished running `prepare_calculation.py`, you will end up with a few files:
  - `prep.out` which gives you information about how your preparation went. If the last line gives you an ending time, that is good news
  - `mol.init.xyz` will be the initial position of your molecule for the optimisation
  - `clust.xyz` is the real system i.e. a cluster of molecules with `mol.init.xyz` in the middle
  - `shell.xyz` is the cluster of molecules without the central one
  - `.temp` files corresponding to all of the parallel calculations

## 3 Running the calculation

### 3.1 Last few steps before running

To run cryspy, all you need is:
  - A `cryspy.in` file
  - `mol.init.xyz`
  - `shell.xyz`
  - `.temp` files
  
And if you intend to use Turbomole or Molcas, directories set up with the appropriate name (`mh`,`mg` and so on).

For Turbomole ricc2, run a define and then write in all of the point charges from `mh.temp` under the block `$point_charges`.

**IMPORTANT**: Turbomole uses Bohr units in its control file and as such the x, y and z columns should be scaled accordingly

For Molcas RASCF, prepare an input file in the directory called `molcas.input` with geom.xyz as the coordinate.
To add point charges, use in `&GATEWAY`:
```
  xfield
[number of charges] Angstrom
 -9.237176  -2.137048   3.557237   0.432218
-10.014996  -1.455739   0.568597  -0.168284
-10.112382  -2.173251   1.384633   0.146427
                .
                .
                .
```

The `cryspy.in` file has a similar structure to the `config` file but is much simpler and is not even necessary for geometry optimisation in Gaussian.
If you want to change a program used in a specific level of theory from gaussian, simply add `high_level [program]` or `low_level [program]`.
For MECI search, add `bool_ci 1`

You should be all set now.
Run `cryspy.py` to begin the calculation.

### 3.2 Outputs

The program only has three main outputs:
  - `cryspy.out` which gives updates on all of the individual energies being calculatedm the total gradient norm and tne energy gap
  - `geom_mol.xyz` which keeps a record of the optimising geometry
  - `geom_cluster.xyz` which combines `geom_mol.xyz` and `shell.xyz` for a better view of intermolecular interactions
